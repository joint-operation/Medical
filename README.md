This project is made by group "Learners".
This is a disease prediction web app using pywebio and sklearn python modules. 
First we train this model using Dataset.csv file  which contains the symptoms and its disease and then we predict the disease based on the input symptoms from the user (test data). 
 The symptom_Description.csv is used to describe the disease the user have .
 The symptoms_precaution.csv file is used to show the precaution the user should take care of.
