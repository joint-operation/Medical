This project is made by group "Learners".
This is a disease prediction web app using pywebio and sklearn python modules. 
First we train this model using Dataset.csv file  which contains the symptoms and its disease and then we predict the disease based on the input symptoms from the user (test data). 
 The symptom_Description.csv is used to describe the disease the user have .
 The symptoms_precaution.csv file is used to show the precaution the user should take care of.
 The symptom_severity.csv file shows the severity of the disease .
 Steps to use:
         1) first we have to write the name of the user.
         2) then, write the age of the user.
         3) after that , we have to write the number of symptoms.
         4) In continuity with this, we have to write the name of the symptoms the user have.
         5) At last, show result.
         6)If the user want to check the disease again ,then press yes otherwise not.
